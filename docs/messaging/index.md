# Messaging Platform

The messaging platform provides event streaming and message queue capabilities using Apache Kafka through the Strimzi operator. This enables building event-driven architectures and real-time data processing pipelines.

## Overview

The messaging platform supports:

- **Event streaming** - High-throughput, low-latency message streaming
- **Event sourcing** - Store and replay application events
- **Microservices integration** - Decouple services through asynchronous messaging
- **Real-time analytics** - Process data streams in real-time

## Key Components

### Strimzi Kafka Operator
Manages Apache Kafka clusters on Kubernetes with automated provisioning, scaling, and maintenance.

### Apache Kafka
Provides the core distributed streaming platform with topics, partitions, and consumer groups.

### Kafka Connect
Enables integration with external systems through connectors for data import/export.

## Documentation Sections

- **[Strimzi Operator CRs](strimzi-operator-crs.md)** - Custom resources for Kafka cluster management

## Getting Started

To work with the messaging platform:

1. Review the [Platform Architecture](../architecture.md) to understand messaging integration
2. Study the [Strimzi Custom Resources](strimzi-operator-crs.md) for configuration details
3. Check the [Development Guide](../development.md) for local development with Kafka
4. Consult [Operations](../operations.md) for production deployment considerations

## Messaging Patterns

### Event Streaming
- **Producer-consumer** - Basic publish-subscribe pattern
- **Event sourcing** - Store events as the source of truth
- **CQRS** - Command Query Responsibility Segregation with events

### Integration Patterns
- **Message transformation** - Convert between different message formats
- **Content-based routing** - Route messages based on content
- **Aggregation** - Combine multiple messages into single results

## Best Practices

### Topic Design
- **Naming conventions** - Use consistent, descriptive topic names
- **Partitioning strategy** - Balance parallelism and ordering requirements
- **Retention policies** - Configure appropriate data retention

### Security
- **Authentication** - Use SASL/SCRAM or mTLS for client authentication
- **Authorization** - Configure topic-level ACLs for access control
- **Encryption** - Enable encryption in transit and at rest

### Performance
- **Batch processing** - Optimize throughput with message batching
- **Compression** - Use appropriate compression algorithms
- **Monitoring** - Track key metrics like lag and throughput
